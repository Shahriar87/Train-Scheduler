## Project Brief

A realtime Train Scheduler using Firebase Realtime Database

## Project Walkthrough
* Starts with a form that requests the train name, destination, first train time, and frequency.  
* Once entered, the train is stored in Firebase and placed in the current train schedule.  
* The frequency, arrival time, and minutes away is determined by MomentJS. 
* Trains can then be updated or removed from the table.

## Technologies Used: 
HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Firebase, MomentJS, jQuery
